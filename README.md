# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

I love the idea of FrontEndMentor. As someone who just wants to learn frontend and doesn't want to spend time focusing on the design part of it, this is a perfect website. 
I wanted to practice working with APIs and learning how to build a dark and light theme was really appealing. I also enjoy the challenge and this was marked as one of the hardest / advanced free projects on there so I wanted to see if I could do it. 

## WHAT I USED
For the project I used HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/). I wanted to focus on working with the basics, that's why so far most of my projects have used vanilla JavaScript, because I want to be completely fluent and proficient in JavaScript, before I start using other frameworks. 

## WHAT I LEARNED
This was mainly an exercise on how to use APIs, the whole design and building part was pretty straight forward. It was the first time I used '--root' to change colors between light and dark, which was fun and I ran into some issues with the API, at first I didn't know what parameters to use when there's a number instead of a name.

## DEPLOYMENT
I deployed it with GitHub pages : https://afcic.github.io/FrontEndMentor_RESTCountriesAPI/
